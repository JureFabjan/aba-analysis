# TODOs: 
# match using manually created mapping of anatomical structures, e.g. based on Sequeira-paper and/or https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6482/eaay5947/tab-figures-data
# match using correlations of orthologues: https://www.proteinatlas.org/humanproteome/brain/mouse+brain

# compare euclidean distances between receptor-occurences per structure per species => see Sequeira fig 7, page 10
