IMPORTANT:
A probe is a plane through the brain in order to detect a specific gene. It contains normalized expression levels and the z-score for each element of the samples-array. "The z-score is computed independently for each probe over all donors and samples." Check out http://help.brain-map.org/display/humanbrain/API for more information.
